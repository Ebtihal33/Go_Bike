## Key Insights for Presentation

>  I mainly focused on ford GoBike system users and the influence of the trip duration, user age and type, and the daily usage of the system, starting by introducing the trip duration variable. Afterward, followed by age, type and gender distribution, then plot the transformed histogram plots.
Afterwards, I introduce each of the categorical variables one by one. To start,
I use the box plots of age to calculate the outliers, then, I introduced the effect of user type and age on long trip duration. to finish, I figured out the top hours of day of users using the bikes with the catplot.
